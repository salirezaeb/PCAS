# Fsched: A Function-as-a-Service Platform with Smart Cache Allocation
**Fsched** is the practical implementation of our proposed system, PCAS (Processor Cache-Aware Scheduler), designed to enhance performance in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) environments. PCAS introduces a cache-conscious scheduling approach, and Fsched brings this concept to life through a fully operational platform.

**Fsched** is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform that optimizes function execution by predicting and allocating the required Last Level Cache (LLC) for each function. The platform follows a **Master-Worker** architecture, where the **Master Node** manages function scheduling and LLC allocation, and the **Worker Nodes** execute the functions.

## Overview

Fsched enhances performance in serverless computing by intelligently predicting and allocating LLC resources. The platform leverages a machine learning model to determine the LLC needs of each function, improving resource utilization and reducing cache misses. It operates in a **Master-Worker** structure, with the master node controlling task distribution and the worker nodes executing tasks efficiently.

## Features

*   **Master-Worker Architecture**: Distributed task scheduling and execution with Rust-based worker nodes and a Python-based master node.
*   **LLC Prediction**: A machine learning model forecasts the LLC requirements for each function before execution.
*   **Cluster Management**: Seamlessly add or remove worker nodes.
*   **Efficient Scheduling**: Dynamically assigns tasks to the most suitable worker node based on predicted LLC requirements.
*   **Scalability**: Add more worker nodes to handle higher workloads without degrading performance.

## Architecture

Fsched's architecture revolves around a **Master Node** and **Worker Nodes**.

### Master Node

The master node is responsible for managing the overall system and is composed of the following key modules:

1.  **Resource Manager**: Manages worker nodes, including adding, removing, and monitoring nodes in the system.
2.  **Controller**: Acts as the central hub, handling incoming function requests, coordinating with the other modules, and ensuring tasks are processed.
3.  **Scheduler**: Schedules tasks on worker nodes based on LLC predictions and available resources.
4.  **Predictor**: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict the required LLC for each function, ensuring optimal scheduling and resource allocation.

### Worker Nodes

Worker nodes, implemented in Rust, execute functions that have been scheduled by the master node. They use the LLC allocated by the master node's prediction model to ensure efficient execution.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x (for the master node)
*   Rust (for building the worker nodes)
*   Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Manni-MinM/fsched.git
    cd fsched
    ```
    
2.  **Master Node Setup (Python)**:
    
    Install the required dependencies for the Python master node:
    
    ```bash
    cd master
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Worker Node Setup (Rust)**:
    
    Navigate to the `worker` directory and build the worker nodes:
    
    ```bash
    cd worker
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Master Node

Start the master node to manage worker nodes and schedule tasks:

```bash
python master/main.py
```

This starts all four modules (Cluster Manager, Controller, Scheduler, and Predictor) and begins accepting function execution requests.

### Running Worker Nodes

On each worker node machine, run the following to start the worker:

```bash
./target/release/worker_node
```

The worker nodes will register with the master node and wait for tasks to execute.

### Example Function Submission

Submit a function to the master node for scheduling and execution:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<master-node-ip>:<port>/submit \
    -d '{"function_name": "my_function", "parameters": {"arg1": "value1"}}'
```

The master node will handle task scheduling, predict the LLC, and dispatch the task to the best-suited worker node.

## API Documentation

The Fsched master node exposes a RESTful API for task management, including the creation, benchmarking, and execution of tasks. Note that while the current implementation uses REST, there are plans to shift to an event-based system (e.g., RabbitMQ) in the future.

            "time": "15ms"
        }
    }
    ```

### Notes

*   In the future, these endpoints will be transitioned to an event-based system using a message broker like RabbitMQ to facilitate asynchronous task handling.
*   For now, the REST API provides a simple and synchronous interface for task management and execution.
